    "# Overview\n",
    "___\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "> This is a flights analysis based on a dataset containing various flight metrics. I chose to focus on the various carriers and their performance (e.g, delay - wise, popularity - wise, etc...), therefore I included features that are relevant to this direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "## setup\n",
    "    - cd <project root>\n",
    "    - python3.11 -m venv venv\n",
    "    - ./venv/Scripts/activate\n",
    "    - pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "- To get the data, either run `gather.py` located in root folder, or add the data manually to the `data` folder. \n",
    "- run `load.py` for loading time and memory optimizations. **REQUIRED**\n",
    "___\n",
    "### About Optimization:\n",
    "**Initially, all yearly dataset consume a lot of memory:**\n",
    "**for example, 1987 alone weighs 484 MB.**\n",
    "Steps taken:\n",
    "1. Convert yearly csv files to feather files for faster loading time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use only relevant column for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Convert numerical columns to lower float type (to 32, so numpy calculations won't be limited by float16 smaller size.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Convert relevant columns to categorical (done by `get_years` function in `load.py` module). Also assists with loading time from feather.\n",
    "___\n",
    "<mark> **NOTE - initally planned to just use unsampled datasets, but\n",
    "visualization operations are taking way too long. yearly sample size is 1000 by default, `get_years` function allows for custom size as well.**</mark>\n",

    "# Exploratory Analysis Findings\n",
    "1. Distribution of departure delays in for each carrier in 2000-2008 (95% of data)\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: looking at all carriers, there are mostly right - skewed distributions. They are unimodal, and most samples are very close to zero, which is a positive finding about delays.\n",
    "2. Distribution of departure delay combined with arrival delay (%90 of data)\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: Most common delay combination is (0,0), followed by values that are close to zero, which is a good thing for delays. Please note that this plot is not meant to provide any information about relationship between arrival and departure delays, but rather provide info about overall distribution of the two variables.\n",
    "3. Most common routes\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: By looking at the graph, we can clearly see the top 10 flight routes.\n",
    "4. yearly flight counts faceted by carrier\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: Overall, Carrier `WN` was the most popular across all years, with many carriers have very low yearly flight counts across all years. Others, like `DL`, reduced dramaticaly over the years. In contrast there's `XE`, that mostly managed to increase through the years.\n",
    "5. Monthly activity for each UniqueCarrier (by flight counts)\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: The most popular carrier overall is `WN`, as seen by its extremely blue - shaded cells across all months. For example, its most popular month is March, followed by April.\n",
    "6. Average air times for each UniqueCarrier\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: It is noticable that the avg. airtime per flight for most carriers is bellow 80. On the other hand, `B6` and `TZ` top the chart with above 150 minutes.\n",
    "7. DepDelay vs ArrDelay (95% of data)\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: Coming back to the heatmap describing these two variables, the correlation between them wasn't noticable. In contrast, here there's a very noticable relatively strong correlation between them. Most values are concentrated around  (0,0), as better described within the heatmap before.\n",
    "8. Distribution of total delay time for each day of the week (95% of data).\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: In all weekdays, there's a right - skewed distribution of total delay time, where the mode is around 0 total delay time - another positive finding about flight delays.\n",
    "9. total delay time by year\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: 2002 - 2003 were the most \"on - time\" years for the flights within the dataset. In contrast, there's 2006 - 2008, which had the most delay.\n",
    "10. Airtime vs Distance (95% of data)\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: There's a strong correlation between airtime and flight distance. Most values are shorter flights in terms of time and distance, and have very low spread, while the larger values are more spread - out and are scarcer.\n",
    "11. Mean Ground Time prop for each UniqueCarrier\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: `EV` spend the largest portion of its flight process on the ground compared to the other carriers. In contrast, there's `OO` which spends the least time on the ground. This finding could be a measure for each carrier's efficiency in executing flights, but more data is required to propely determine their efficiency, such as the airports they use, or any other limiting factors that a carrier could ecounter.\n",
    "12. Distribution  of flight distance\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: It is observed that the most probable distances are up to 1000, when larger distances are much less probable, even more so as the distance goes above 3000.\n",
    "13. Cancelled flights prop for each UniqueCarrier\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: `MQ` has the highest cancellation rate, while `HA` and `F9` has no cancellations over the sampled dataset. This is implies that it is probable that their rate would be the lowest, if not zero, even if the whole dataset would be included, not just 9,000 records.\n",
    "14. Distribution of elapsed time\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: Most flights have elapsed time between 50 to 150. After that, the proportion is only decreasing.\n",
    "15. Mean flight speed by Distance\n",
    "> <mark>Findings: The avg. speed significantly increases between the three first bins of width 1000km. then, it's barely increasing above 8 km / minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base visualizations for presentation:\n",
    " \n",
    "    \n",
    "I would include in my explanatory analysis the following:\n",
    "- vis #15 - mean flight speed, as this metric is an essential piece of infomation about flights that was not originally included in the dataset.\n",
    "- vis #11 - mean ground time, beacause it is a useful metirc in observing how much time of a given flight is actually spent within airports. This data is as well is not given in the dataset, but I find it interesting to present, as it can offer a different perpective to look on each carrier's performance.\n",
    "- vis #6 - avg. air times by unique carrier, should present on the same dashboard with avg. ground time, in order to show two sides of the flight process.\n",
    "- vis #4 - yearly flight counts by carrier, and will present it with total yearly delay by carrier, in order to illustrate a potential impact. \n",
    "- vis #12 - Distribution of flight distance. This vis combined with the speed visualization could comprehensively describe flight air time metric.\n",
    "-vis #10 - Airtime vs Distance, would add this to the same dashboard with speed and distribution of distance."
